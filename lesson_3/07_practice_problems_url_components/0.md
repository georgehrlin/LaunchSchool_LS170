Q: What are two different ways to encode a space in a query parameter? We didn't cover this in the lectures, so feel free to search online for the answer.
A: `%20` and `+`. According to the general URI specification (RFC 3986), `%20` is the most standard way and can be used anywhere in a URL. `+` is a shorthand method specifically used for query parameters, making it only valid after the `?` in a URL.
